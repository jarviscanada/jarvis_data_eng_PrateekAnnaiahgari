# Sai Prateek Reddy Annaiahgari . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate with strong knowledge of software design, development, and testing. I have experience in different programming languages like C, python, C#, Java and Scala and various tools by Apache Software Foundation. My broad educational background with excellent analytical, technical, and programming skills has helped me secure a job at Jarvis as a Data Engineer. At Jarvis, I have worked as a team to develop efficient software solutions to complex real-world business problems. As a result of my ability to quickly learn new technologies in a dynamic field like Software engineering, I will be a great fit for an equally dynamic team and organization as a Software Engineer.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring agent program using Linux Bash script to log hardware specifications, and the resource usage of each node in a Linux cluster running on CentOS7. The shell script can insert data into a PostgreSQL database which is provisioned using docker. The usage data is collected every minute using Crontab. Collected data can be queried using SQL to answer specific resource usage questions.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a Twitter CLI tool, using Java 8 and Twitter REST API that allows users to access their Twitter account. Provides basic operations like Post, Show and Delete tweets. Managed dependencies using Springboot. Implemented using DAO design pattern and, built and packaged using Maven. Tested the app using JUnit4 and Mockito. Deployed using Docker on Dockerhub.
  - JDBC App: Created a JDBC application that leverages the JDBC driver APIs to connect to PostgrsSQL database. Implemented using a DAO design pattern and, built and packaged using Maven. Deployed using Docker on Dockerhub.
  - Grep App: Implemented a grep app in java that searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory, similar to the linux's GREP command.  Built and packaged using Maven and deployed using Docker on Dockerhub.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/springboot)]: Developed a proof-of-concept trading application in java that uses microservice architecture to replace Jarvis's exisiting monolithic application. Provides features for users to manage trading accounts, pull and post market data. Managed using Maven and Springboot. Database connectivity using DataSource and JDBC APIs. Tested the app using Junit4 integration tests. Deployed as web servlet with SwaggerUI and Apache Tomcat using docker on Dockerhub.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Analysed retail data of London Gift Shop(LGS), a client of jarvis, to investigate the dwindling revenue in recent years.Stored the customer data in a PostgreSQL data warehouse containerized in Docker. Used Pandas, Numpy and MatplotLib for data wrangling and visualization; and saved the analysis in Jupyter notebook. 

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/hadoop)]: Currently in progress!

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/spark)]: Not Started

**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PrateekAnnaiahgari/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: Not Started


## Highlighted Projects
**Web app Tracking UFO Sightings**: Developed a Web application using ASP.NET that uses stored procedures to access UFO data stored in MSSQL server to produce the location map of UFOs on Google maps. Utilizes Google maps API to produce cluster maps and graphic icon maps of UFO sighting locations all around the world.

**Flight Computer**: Developed a WPF application that can calculate Flight routes based on the selected Waypoints. Implemented in C# and gathers Globlal airports data stored in MSSQL Server using Stored procedures.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Worked in an Agile/Scrum team and developed various Software projects. The projects were implemented using various tools and technologies like Linux, Java, Springboot, Docker, PostgreSql, Git and GCP.
