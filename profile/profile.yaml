# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "I am a recent graduate with strong knowledge of software design, development, and testing. I have experience in different programming languages like C, python, C#, Java and Scala and 
various tools by Apache Software Foundation. My broad educational background with excellent analytical, technical, and programming skills has helped me secure a job at Jarvis as a Data Engineer. 
At Jarvis, I have worked as a team to develop efficient software solutions to complex real-world business problems. As a result of my ability to quickly learn new technologies in a dynamic field 
like Software engineering, I will be a great fit for an equally dynamic team and organization as a Software Engineer."
