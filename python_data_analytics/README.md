# Introduction
London Gift Shop(LGS) is an online gift-ware store in London,UK. The Store has been underdeveloping in terms of revenue in the recent years. The LGS marketing team has collaborated with Jarvis to use IT based data analysis to study their customer shopping behavior.  
The LGS marketing will use the analytics to develop better sales and marketing strategies to retain existing customers and attract new customers.    

This Proof-of-Concept project utilizes Python Jupyter Notebook and various python libraris like; `Pandas`, `Numpy` and `MatPlotLib`; to perform data analysis and data visualization. Client retail data was loaded into a PostgreSql Database and later imported to Jupyter Notebook. 

# Implementaion
## Project Architecture
LGS's sytem maintains their web application, both front-end and backend in an integrated Microsoft Azure Environment. After dumping the client's personal information using an ETL process, the LGS IT team has provided the Jarvis team with the transaction data from the year 2009 to 2011 into the `retail.sql` file. The file is used to store the data into a PostgresSql Database and the data is analysed and visualized using a Jupyter Notebook.
